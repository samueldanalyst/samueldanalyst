### 🚀 About Me

💻 I'm currently enrolled in the **ALX Pro Backend Engineering** program, where I’m mastering modern backend technologies including Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, and cloud deployment.

🌱 My passion for software engineering began with a curiosity to understand how the systems we use daily are built. The turning point came when I realized how data and code could be combined to solve real-world problems.

🎯 My goal is to become a **Senior Backend Engineer**, building robust systems at scale. One project I’m currently working on is **Roommate Match** — a smart backend system that uses algorithms to help people find compatible roommates based on data and preferences.
